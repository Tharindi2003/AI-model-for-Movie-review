🎬 AI Model for Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to analyze and classify movie reviews as positive or negative. It uses text preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning to understand the sentiment behind each review.

🚀 Features

Clean and preprocess text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF / Word Embeddings

Train and evaluate ML/DL models (e.g., Logistic Regression, LSTM, or BERT)

Predict the sentiment of new user-input reviews

Visualize model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

🧠 Technologies Used
